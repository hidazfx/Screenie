#How do I use Screenie?
To use Screenie, the setup is a bit confusing and un-intuitive. You have to set your Server and Channel through the config file, so grab the ServerID and ChannelID and put them into their respective lines in "config.properties". After this, go ahead and double click the screenie Jar file.
