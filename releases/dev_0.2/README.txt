This build of Screenie is unsupported! It may still contain bugs and or unintended things.
-----------------------------
Some reasons you may be wanting to use an older version of Screenie:
* Older versions are typically more lightweight
That's about it. That's really all I can think of.
-----------------------------
This specific version SHOULD be able to use the dev_0.3 config file, as I have deleted my local config file for dev_0.2. It requires an E-Mail, Password, Server ID and Channel ID in the config. If there are any issues, I'm sorry but you can try to make your own fork of Screenie if you'd like and modify it however you want.
